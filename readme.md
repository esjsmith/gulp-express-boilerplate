## Gulp Setup
### gulp-inject
  - The source of the index.jade will be in the /src/dev-index.jade file. Once wiredep and gulp-inject do their jobs and list the dependencies, the file will be destined to the `views` folder, which is where the express server will look for it.

### wiredep
See `gulp-inject`.
